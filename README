This is Crypt::OpenPGP. It provides a pure-Perl implementation of the
OpenPGP standard, including support for all versions of PGP and
GnuPG.

PREREQUISITES

Crypt::OpenPGP requires the following Perl modules:

    * MIME::Base64
    * Data::Buffer
    * Math::Pari

Depending on which symmetric ciphers you use, you will require
at least one of the following modules:

    * Crypt::DES (for 3DES)
    * Crypt::IDEA (for IDEA)
    * Crypt::Blowfish (for Blowfish)

And depending on which public key algorithms you use, you will
require at least one of the following modules:

    * Crypt::RSA (for RSA encryption/decryption and signatures)
    * Crypt::DSA (for DSA signatures)

Note that currently ElGamal for encryption and decryption is
provided by Crypt::OpenPGP itself; once Crypt::ElGamal is up on
CPAN, Crypt::OpenPGP will be switched to use that support instead.

INSTALLATION

Crypt::OpenPGP installation is straightforward. If your cpan shell is
set up, you should just be able to do

    % perl -MCPAN -e 'install Crypt::OpenPGP'

Answer the questions as to which encodings you prefer to use,
and you'll be on your way.

If you don't like that, you can download the distribution; the
latest version on CPAN can be found in

    ftp://ftp.cpan.org/pub/CPAN/authors/id/B/BT/BTROTT/

Download it, unpack it, then build it as per the usual:

    % perl Makefile.PL
    % make && make test

Then install it:

    % make install
