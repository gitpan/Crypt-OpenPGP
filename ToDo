Crypt::OpenPGP todo
--------
xx * Crypt::OpenPGP main USAGE docs
* docs (for other classes)
* support for CAST5, ElGamal signing
xx * compressed packets
* symmetrically-encrypted encrypted data packets
xx * make find_keyblock_by_keyid work with subkeys
xx * key generation, secret certificate saving and encrypting
xx * Crypt::OpenPGP high-level DWIM interface
xx * support for armouring
xx * support for writing packets (v4 fingerprints/key IDs will come with this)
* more support for looking up keys in keyring (eg. look up userid, etc.)
* keyblock merging keys, signatures, user IDs
xx * implement a KeyRing::find method that looks only for specific key IDs, etc.
xx * generate fingerprint on cert while reading in (in 'parse'); that way we
     don't have to reserialize
* Crypt::OpenPGP::Plaintext::encrypt should encrypt data and return a
  Crypt::OpenPGP::Ciphertext packet
* improve CRC24 implementation by using C implementation. problem:
  String::CRC does not work for me (doesn't accept init, for one thing).
* check all errors
* add tests for more versions of PGP, more pkalgs, more ciphers, etc.
  to the test suite.
* improve subpacket system: constants for types, better integration into
  signatures, etc.
xx * better installation: determine prereqs based on answers to prompts
     about preferred ciphers, pk systems, etc.
* use key flags to determine "what a key can do" (ie. signing, encryption)
* support writing v4 packet headers
* add some example scripts
