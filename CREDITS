In developing Crypt::OpenPGP I have received help (either direct or
indirect) from the following individuals, who I would like to thank:

* Gary Howland's original pure-Perl PGP code (part of Cryptix) was
useful when I was planning the structure of the code, in
implementing the CRC24 algorithm, and for the basis of the (now
reworked) CFB code.

* Vipul Ved Prakash, from whose Convert::ASCII::Armour I borrowed
some regexen for unarmouring data, and who has helped out enormously
with testing against various PGP releases, sending patches, etc.
