This is Crypt::OpenPGP, a pure-Perl implementation of the OpenPGP
standard.

Each of the Crypt::OpenPGP symmetric ciphers depends on a Crypt::
module from the CPAN. You may already have the necessary module(s)
installed, in which you don't need to bother with this step.
Otherwise you'll need to select a cipher to use with Crypt::OpenPGP.
Please choose at least one from the following list (3DES is the
default).

Crypt::OpenPGP also requires at least one public-key implementation;
it may require more, depending on what types of keys you use in
your other PGP applications. Each public-key implementation may
depend on a Crypt:: module from the CPAN. You may already have the
necessary module(s) installed, in which you don't need to bother with
this step. Otherwise you'll need to select a public-key implementation
to use with Crypt::OpenPGP. Please choose at least one from the
following list (DSA and ElGamal are the defaults).

Crypt::OpenPGP depends on several external modules for functionality.
Some of these modules can not be found on your system; they can be
installed automatically for you. To do so will require loading the
CPAN shell, which may require you to be running as root. Answer 'n' to
each of the following questions if you'd rather not install any
needed modules right now; note, however, that you'll still need to
install them to use Crypt::OpenPGP.
